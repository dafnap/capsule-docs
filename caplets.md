# Caplets

You can customize many of the capsule's inner workings by creating a caplet -- *custom capsule*. A caplet is a subclass of the `Capsule` class that overrides some of its overridable methods.

Please consult Capsule's [Javadoc](http://puniverse.github.io/capsule/capsule/javadoc/Capsule.html) for specific documentation on custom capsules.

## Available Caplets

* [capsule-maven](https://github.com/puniverse/capsule-maven) - Resolves artifacts against a Maven repository if not embedded in the capsule.

## Launching, Manipulating, and Creating Capsules Programmatically

The [capsule-util](http://puniverse.github.io/capsule/capsule-util/javadoc/) sub-project contains classes to create and interact with capsule's at runtime. See the Javadocs [here](http://puniverse.github.io/capsule/capsule-util/javadoc/).
